The Experiment I directory contains code for showing Figure 3, (a)-(c) in the IEEE Tran. on Vis and TVCG paper. 

The Experiment II directory contains code for showing Figure 8 (a)-(c) in the same paper. 

In both cases, you will have to run through all of them to see these since the code is for the empirical study and we donâ€™t allow participants to customize the variables.

# To compile Experiment I

cd Experiment\ I/LabExperiment1/program/experiment/jcUtil
  
  make
  
  cd ../
  
  make
  
#To run:

./main 1 1 
  
 you may also try ./main 2 2 or any combinations below of ./main <parameter1> <parameter2>
 
 participantID parameter1 parameter2

where parameter2 is the block ID (the row index in a latin square)
parameter1 is the index in the current block.


Similarily, one may compile the training program by doing the following:

# To compile:
  
  cd Experiment\ I/LabExperiment1/program/training/jcUtil
  
  make 
  
  cd ../
  
  make
 
# To run: 
  
  ./run
  
----------------------------------
# To compile experiment 2, please use the same steps.

# To compile:
 
  cd Experiment\ II/LabExperiment2/BivariateStudy2/jcUtil
  
  make
  
  cd ..
  
  make
  
  
# To run the training code:
  
  ./startTraining 1

# To run the formal study code:
  
  ./startFormal 1 
   
----------------------------------

Quantum spin visualizations will appear on the screen. Left mouse drag will rotate the scene. One may also click the button to move to the next task.
