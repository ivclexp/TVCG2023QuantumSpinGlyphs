#================Description==================#
This study is the first lab-based experiment of bivariate features.

Independent variables: 
	bivariate features(length-length, color-length, texture-length, volume, and color-volume)

Tasks:
	1. Read magnitude
	2. Ratio
	3. Comparison
	4. Max



#=================Data===================#
The data are generated by moving a box (5x3x3) in quantum physics data
The number of vectors in each data is around 450.
